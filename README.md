*FlySimpleLogbook* is an electronic Logbook designed for General Aviation pilots which help them to record their flight
information for each flight.
The application will be able to record important flight information such as Date, Aircraft information, flight time
during day and night and the route of the flight.

The pilot can enter the start and end time of each flight, and the program will calculate the duration of it.
Given the logbook entries, the application will be able to calculate total flying hours of the pilot.

It's the pilot's responsibility to keep track of their flying hours and keep their logbooks up to date. A logbook 
contains crucial information of the pilot which should contain accurate flying hours with correct calculation. 
However, it is a repetitive process to write down hours by hand each time and calculating the sum of flying hours by hand
creates the possibility of making algebra mistakes. As a private pilot myself, I have been researching for a way to 
digitalis my paper logbook using a simple and user-friendly program. Therefore, it inspires me to use this opportunity
to create an electronic logbook to simplify the process of logging flying hours for pilots. Computers are good at executing
the same commands repeatedly, which makes it a good tool for pilots to maintain their logbooks. The fundamentals of this 
logbook program is transferable, and can be adapted easily to other professions, such as recording flying hours of an 
aircraft for maintenance purpose, recording work experience for aircraft maintenance engineers, and so much more.
